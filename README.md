- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Sashadf1
- I model residential building energy consumption for non profit Post Road Foundation through NREL's ResStock, OpenStudio, and EnergyPlus software.
- I am proficient in Python, MATLAB, Ruby, and Excel.
- Looking to improve my skills with the OpenStudio SDK, measure writing, OpenStudio-Parametric Analysis Tool and scripting to work with outputs. 
- Looking to collaborate with other energy modelers/software developers to learn, help one-another, and further develop useful skills.
